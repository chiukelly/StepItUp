* StepItUp Freetail Hack 2020
* Problem: Over the past few months, we have faced a worldwide pandemic, drastically altering our day-to-day lives. Whether it is being under lockdown, taking a prolonged break from work, or being home from school, staying active has become a common challenge.
* Solution/The Process: To overcome this decline or period of decreased activity, we have created an app called StepItUp. The app primarily focuses on motivating users to get up and walk by competing with friends to see who can walk the most each week. Users earn coins for every step they take, which can later be used to purchase items to design their own personalized avatars. This provides a fun and competitive experience to encourage users to remain healthy and active during the pandemic. Steps are tracked within the app by collecting data from the user's phone using IOS HealthKit.
* Implementation (front end and back end): For implementation, we utilized Amazon Web Services to manage our back-end resources. We used the EC2 cloud compute service to host an instance of our REST API server, which we coded in Python. Additionally, we utilized the provided Relational Database Service to host our MySQL database. On the front end, we used Apple's Xcode to code our UI design in Swift, employing a combination of Storyboard and Programmatic implementation for the visual layout, and a series of web requests for the frontend-backend connection.
